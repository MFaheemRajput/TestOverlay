This project demonstrates a problem I am having when using an image as the overlay view in the UIImagePickerController. The overlay is offset by about 50 pixels.

When you run the app on your iPhone, it will open the camera and allow you to take a photo. That photo will be used as the overlay view, and the camera will open again.
